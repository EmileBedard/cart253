# Ideas for mod jam !

frog is changing name everytime it eats a fly
when time runs, the frog gets more and more hungry and the skin color fades to grey, ounce it eats, the frog gains saturation
every fly has a different flight pattern chose randomly
every fly going off screen after passing is removing a point from score
once you have 10 points, you move to a different stage with a miniboss inbetween
frog laughs if it fails to capture the fly
frog tongue length is based on charging value of mouseclicked
on a random rate, some flies fall in love together
