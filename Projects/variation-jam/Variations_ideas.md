a few ideas for some variations
- american abstract expressionism (pollock)
- pointillism (maybe too similar to ploock?)
- cubism (reduce frame rate and change color to make rigid lines with hard angles)
- pop art (make the drawing to be many many instances from an array of brand logo maybe)
- expressionism (the coordinates of mouse are multiplied to really emphasise the user's movements, making them exagerated.)
