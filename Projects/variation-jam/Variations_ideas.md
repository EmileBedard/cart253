a few ideas for some variations
- american abstract expressionism (pollock)
- pointillism (maybe too similar to ploock?)
- cubism (reduce frame rate and change color to make rigid lines with hard angles)
- pop art (make the drawing to be many many instances from an array of brand logo maybe)
- expressionism (the coordinates of mouse are multiplied to really emphasise the user's movements, making them exagerated.)

Maybe add a game to reproduce famous paintings ? like show for a few seconds the painting, then let the user draw and after 30s, the painting comes back and we can compare how well the user succeeded, could be fun.
