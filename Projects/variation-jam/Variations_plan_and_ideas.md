### a few ideas for some variations
- american abstract expressionism (pollock)
- pointillism (maybe too similar to ploock?)
- cubism (reduce frame rate and change color to make rigid lines with hard angles)
- pop art (make the drawing to be many many instances from an array of brand logo maybe)
- expressionism (the coordinates of mouse are multiplied to really emphasise the user's movements, making them exagerated.)
- refus global? (something more unusual here, i could make a JSON with quotes from the original manifesto and as you move the mouse around, the quotes appear at the color seleceted on random coordinates?)
- poussin vs rubens
- générateur d'odalisques
- Madonna and child
- Neoplasticism with piet mondrian

> Maybe add a game to reproduce famous paintings ? like show for a few seconds the painting, then let the user draw and after 30s, the painting comes back and we can compare how well the user succeeded, could be fun.

>It would be fun to have a color palette! Presented on the side, when you click on a certain color, it assigns the color to your brush
>( this could could be utilized for the movements too. For example: the drawing vs color battle with Poussin and rubens at paris royal painting and sculpting academia in 1671 )

### Favorite ideas for now:
- Neoplasticism with piet mondrian
- american abstract expressionism (pollock)
- expressionism (the coordinates of mouse are multiplied to really emphasise the user's movements, making them exagerated.)
