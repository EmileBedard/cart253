### This game is adapting the original **Frog Frog Frog** game by Pippin Barr. Here is every modification that was implemented:
- The new wood frog theme was added! This adds a new objective, reaching maximum glycogen and freezing hibernation. It also affected the visual aspect of the frog. I drew the complete brown body with the two eyes to mimic the real wood frogs.
- New insects appeared with new moving patterns! The fly got some new buzzing wings and a wavy flying pattern, an unsure ant appeared that goes back and forth and finally a twirly spider that moves in circles.
- A new starting and ending screen was added! with the big fly in the title screen that you have to eat to start the game.
- I added mobile compatibility and touch control to have a wider target audience and let the game be enjoyed way more!
- And finally added a new control system. touch for mobile and "A", "L" and spacebar to play on desktop. I am very satisfied with this new modified version of the original game!
