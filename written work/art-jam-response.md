    Jake's work is surprisingly simple and minimalist, yet powerful.
    I'll first go over the interesting aspect of the experience that the user is interacting with, 
    then, the interesting aspects of his code. His portrait is the only one that I witnessed that 
    is showing full body, and not only that, full body moving!! This decision made me rethink of my 
    theater days and more specifically puppet theatre. Playing with the character, getting him out 
    of the canvas and bringing him back was lots of fun. Even in this simple form, we can build a 
    minimal narrative haha. **Live reaction here**. I **just** discovered while reading his readme
    that we are able to rotate the character according to the canvas origin. This definitely opens
    possibility for narrative building. Why is he coming from the sky upside down, why is he peeking
    from the left border of the canvas? Is he hiding dark secrets ? mischievous jake... As for his 
    code, I love that he embraced the canvas origin as his rotation point, a new approach to interaction.

    Here is a new take on the self-portrait art jam that I find very compelling. Coming from a fine arts
    background, i see color as a really meaningful and powerful aspect of an artwork and one of the most
    important choice as an artist. So to see this blue invasion is something that leaves me questioned and
    hooked to know more from the artist. The portrait is facing left, showing her right profile under earphones
    and a blue-ish hair color Eyes staring forward and neutral eyebrows show fearlessness, bravery and courage
    from Nerly. I love those choices because they truly do reflect what she wanted, show her desired vibe.
    As for the code, I love the addition of the "dragpoint". It helps the user understand where he is and what
    is happening when the mouse is clicked and dragged. It shows a start of UX design to simply show user that
    their actions are heard. The red color is also interesting here, very contrasting with hot color compared
    to the cool blue hues of the rest of the composition.
    
> ### Liam St-Georges jam, a cool dude take on self portrait.

    Liam's portrait is joyful, kind, playful and so amusing with the dancing eyebrows. I definitely see how he
    wants to be perceived and what's' his kind of vibe. the interaction with the hand and the fingers moving in “OK” position when
    The mouse is clicked is also so amusing. He seems to be so chill, relaxed and laid back. Like everything is cool,
    just click and he won't flinch, eyebrows seducing and waving their way to complement the chill dude stare and
    the flexy fingers showing such approval, I absolutely love it haha. The canvas size is also playing a big role
    in this interpretation, choosing something small and focused is framing his composition in a window, making it
    even more inviting to reach in, control his hands and become friends. The absence of the "traditional" cursor is
    something interesting in his code and that i really want to try out in the future, I really feel it has creative
    capabilities and it could be interesting to implement it even with a different icon, maybe a custom one ?! For
    his use of the cursor, I like that it is not apparent and leaves the composition uninterrupted. We still get the
    benefit of the cursor with the hand moving according to mouse X and Y coordinates so it really is no compromise,
    we get visual delight combined with functionality. I love it.
